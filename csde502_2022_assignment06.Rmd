# Explanation {.unnumbered}
For this assignment, you will be perusing some of the documentation for the Add Health Wave 1 data set. You will use the documentation to make some updates to a data frame containing some of the Add Health data, and then save the data frame as an RDS file. You will update a metadata table that partially describes the data set and changes you made to the variable names and variable labels.

To open a Stata version 13 file in R there are two main options:

1. Use `haven::read_dta()`.  
To access variable labels in R, use `labelled::foreign_to_labelled()`.   
To update variable labels, use the `labelled::var_label()` function. 
1. Use `readstata13::read.dta13()`.   
Variable labels for this format are available, e.g., for a data frame named `dat` as `attributes(dat)$var.labels`.   
This is a vector of text strings that can be updated by assigning a new value to the specified element, e.g., `attributes(dat)$var.labels[1] <- "foo"`. 

To save the RDS file, use the base function `saveRDS()`.

Here is a base R code snippet that will rename a single variable:

```{md}
colnames(data_frame)[grep("^original_variable_name$", colnames(data_frame))] <- new_variable_name
```

The `grep()` function finds the position of the named variable in the list of variables in the data frame. The characters `^` and `$` are regular expressions to specify the start and end of the string to be matched (assuring that the pattern does not match multiple similar variable names).

It is much simpler with tidyverse and magrittr: 

```{md}
data_frame %<>% rename(new_variable_name = old_variable_name)
```

Additional hint for dealing with PDF documentation: 

1. Use `pdfgrep` (should be available in a Linux or Mac package manager; for Windows use [https://pdfgrep.org/](https://pdfgrep.org/) or use [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/packages/summary/pdfgrep.html).
1. Use the R `pdftools` package. This could be used in a loop over each PDF file to create a data frame with the name of the PDF file, page number, and text of each page. The `str_match()` function could be used to identify the file name and page number where specific text strings occur. For a minimal example, this shows that the string "h1gi1m" is found on page 1 of INH01PUB.PDF. Conversion of the PDF fileâ€™s text to lowercase simplifies the matching, as in this example:

```
> x <- pdftools::pdf_text(pdf = "INH01PUB.PDF")
> str_match(string = x %>% str_to_lower(), pattern = "h1gi1m")
      [,1]    
 [1,] "h1gi1m"
 [2,] NA      
 [3,] NA      
 [4,] NA      
 [5,] NA      
 [6,] NA      
 [7,] NA      
 [8,] NA      
 [9,] NA      
[10,] NA      
[11,] NA      
[12,] NA      
[13,] NA      
[14,] NA      
[15,] NA
```

# Instructions {.unnumbered}

1. Download and make changes to [this Rmd file](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1515226/files/87787809/download) (the same one that generated the HTML file you are reading). Make sure you include your name and any optional link in the `author` field in the YAML header.

1. Any answers that rely on R or other code should be documented explicitly, e.g., in R code chunks in the Rmd, or with inline code (e.g., `` `r "\u0060r mean(x)\u0060"` ``).
1. Render your Rmd file to HTML format.
1. Convert your completed Rmd file to PDF format (do not render as PDF, just print the raw text of the Rmd file as PDF).
1. Upload the HTML and PDF files to the [course Canvas site](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1515226).

# Question 1

## 
What was the sampling frame for this study?

<div class="answer">
It is stratified sampling. In particular, nationally-representative longitudinal survey of adolescents of students in grades 7-12. So far it has taken 5 waves with a series of in-home interviews conducted in 1995, 1996, 2001-02, 2008, and 2016-18. 
</div>

##
What were the three kinds of respondents at Wave I?

<div class="answer">
Households for in-home interview, students from schools, and neighborhoods 
</div>

## 
What was the instrument with the largest sample size?

<div class="answer">
Answer
</div>

## 
Is it possible for a respondent to be in Wave III without being in Wave II?

<div class="answer">
Yes it is possible. 
</div>

## 
What is the time span (start and end dates) of the Add Health data collection (all waves)?

<div class="answer">
1995, 1996, 2001-02, 2008, and 2016-18. 
</div>

## 
What is the difference between the public and the restricted-use Add Health data?

<div class="answer">
The restricted-use data requires researchers to have an IRB-approval letter. 
</div>

Describe a research question that you might be able to answer using the Add Health dataset. 

<div class="answer">
Any research questions associated with health condition changes over the years.

# Question 3
Download the file [AHwave1_v1.dta](https://canvas.uw.edu/files/87730694/download?download_frd=1).

## 
Fill in the grey missing cells in `r table_nums(name = "t1", display = "cite")` below based on the data and/or documentation. Optimally, use the documentation to familiarize yourself with the structure of the code books.

<div class="answer">
```{r}

# unzip the file
if(file.exists("data/AHwave1_v1.dta.zip") & !file.exists("data/AHwave1_v1.dta")){
    unzip(zipfile = "data/AHwave1_v1.dta.zip", exdir = "data")
}

# read the data
AHwave1_v1_haven <- haven::read_dta(file = "data/AHwave1_v1.dta") %>% 
  dplyr::select(aid, imonth, iday,iyear,bio_sex,h1gi1m, h1gi1y, h1gi4,h1gi6a,h1gi6b,h1gi6c,h1gi6d,h1gi6e,h1gi8,h1gi9,h1gh1)



AHwave1_v1_haven_metadata <- bind_cols(
    # variable name
    `new variable name` = c("aid","imonth","iday","iyear","bio_sex","bmonth","byear","hispanic","white","black","AI","asian","raceother","onerace",
    "observedrace","health"),

    `original variable name` = colnames(AHwave1_v1_haven),
    `status*` = c(rep("unchanged", 5), rep("renamed", 11)),
    `data type` = c("text", rep("renamed", 15)),
    `new variable label` = lapply(AHwave1_v1_haven, function(x) attributes(x)$label) %>% 
        unlist(),
    `codebook file name` = c(rep("SECTAPUB.PDF", 4), rep("INH01PUB.PDF", 12))



)

DT::datatable(AHwave1_v1_haven_metadata)


```
</div>

## 
Using questions 6 and 8 in `INH01PUB.PDF`, create a new variable named "race" that uses recoded values (white = 1; black/African American = 2; American Indian = 3; Asian/Pacific Islander = 4; other = 5; unknown/missing = 9). 

<div class="answer">
Answer
</div>

## 
Rename the variables, and update variable labels using `r table_nums(name = "t1", display = "cite")` as a guide and save the data frame as the file as `AHwave1_v2.RDS`. To make these changes and to save the RDS file, include R code as a code chunk in this document.

<div class="answer">


```{r}
saveRDS(AHwave1_v1_haven_metadata, file = "data/AHwave1_v2.RDS")

```

</div>

## 
Update the status in `r table_nums(name = "t1", display = "cite")` as needed. 

A [Word document is available for editing](https://canvas.uw.edu/files/87787650/download?download_frd=1). Make changes to the document and then paste in a screen capture of the edited table. *Note: although this is not a preferred, reproducible, code-driven method, sometimes we do need to compromise our principles for the sake of expediency. It is rather complicated to create tables in R Markdown output with column and/or row spanning.*
